      <description><![CDATA[<p>This blog post was originally posted <a href="https://initialcapacity.io/initial-monitor">on the initialCapacity website</a></p>
<h2>A desktop project monitor in F#.</h2>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>We are sharing the <a href="https://github.com/initialcapacity/project-monitor">source code to our custom project monitor</a>.
This is a great way to get started with <a href="https://fsharp.org/">programming in F#</a> and grasping stateful application architecture.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We recently built <a href="https://github.com/initialcapacity/project-monitor">our own project monitor</a> to keep
track of the status of our continuous integration builds. We’ve built a few over the past decade or so and
decided to take a slightly different approach this time by building a desktop application in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<p>The application is running on a local computer connected to a 55” TV monitor in our office. The machine is
an Intel NUC running <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a>.
So, that’s right, the app was written in a functional first language, built on Windows, deployed on Linux.</p>
<p>We decided to go for a cross-platform desktop application to make the app easier to deploy and configure on
individual, commodity machines that were dormant and likely laying around our office collecting dust. Since
it’s easy to compile <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> for any platform we could have deployed the app to a
Raspberry PI or a Mac Mini. In addition, we’re not paying for any hosting costs related to configuring or
serving up a web application.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.damo.io/posts/initial-monitor/initial-monitor.png" alt="A screenshot of the project monitor" />
A screenshot of the monitor.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Running the application requires you to pass in the path to a JSON configuration file. The JSON file should
follow the structure <a href="https://github.com/initialcapacity/project-monitor/blob/main/DesktopApp/res/ConfigSample.json">from the provided sample</a>.
We could have spent more time building a fancy UI but in the spirit of starting simple we
favored being able to ship a binary alongside a JSON file - which is much more convenient for our use case.</p>
<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<p>Here is a quick look at the technologies we used to build the application -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">JetBrains Rider</a></li>
<li>or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> + <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Design</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the application is developed with the
<a href="https://avaloniaui.net/">cross-platform desktop application framework AvaloniaUI</a> and its
<a href="https://avaloniacommunity.github.io/Avalonia.FuncUI.Docs/">F# companion library Avalonia.FuncUI</a>.</p>
<p>The application launches a single window which runs a small <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elm-ish application</a>,
implementing a <strong>Unidirectional Data Flow architecture</strong>. This architecture was originally introduced by
the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm programming suite</a> and popularized by <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>.</p>
<p>When building stateful applications like desktop applications, native mobile applications, or web frontend
applications, it becomes increasingly important to understand how to deal with state. We have found this
paradigm shift new to the majority of companies that we’ve worked with over the years. Unidirectional data
flow is one of the cleanest ways of thinking about UI and its state. The architecture relies heavily on the
UI being represented by pure functions and not thinking about how the UI changes overtime - but how
individual areas of the application should render given the current state.</p>
<p>State is changed through dispatching events and is decoupled from the rendering of the view itself.</p>
<h2>Adding layouts for more projects</h2>
<p>The application supports displaying 1 to 6 projects at the time this article is published. To support more
projects, we can change the <a href="https://github.com/initialcapacity/project-monitor/blob/main/DesktopApp/src/Layout.fs">Layout module</a>
to support different sized grids. Understanding <a href="https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/controls/grid">AvaloniaUI's Grid</a>
is a great starting point to better understand the layout module.</p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>While the GitHub Action is already configured, publishing for <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>MacOS</strong>
or <strong>Windows</strong> is a one line command:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet publish -c release -r &lt;release-identifier&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Release identifiers can be, for example: <code>osx-x64</code>, <code>linux-x64</code>, <code>win10-x64</code> and they can be targeted
from any of these operating systems, effectively cross compiling the resulting binary.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>That’s a wrap! We hope you enjoyed the article.</p>

      <title>Error handling in Kotlin and any modern static type system</title>
      <link>https://blog.damo.io/posts/error-handling-in-kotlin-and-any-modern-static-type-system</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.damo.io/posts/error-handling-in-kotlin-and-any-modern-static-type-system</guid>
      <pubDate>2018-08-15T23:15:56+00:00</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This article is about leveraging a technique called <strong>Railway Oriented
Programming</strong>, in <strong>Kotlin</strong>. It is extensively documented in functional
languages,
<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/">particularly well in the F# community.</a>
So I’m going to try to explain how to implement some of it in <strong>Kotlin</strong>.</p>
<h2>Some background</h2>
<p>Having written my fair share of <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>… I’ve seen quite a
few different paradigms for error handling.</p>
<p><strong>In Ruby</strong>, one would return different types based on the error status of a
given function. We would (for example) use symbols to indicate the specific type
of error that was reached (e.g. <code>:not_found</code>, <code>:connection_failed</code>…).</p>
<p>It then becomes the responsibility of the consumer of the function to figure out
the different possible results. The programmer ends up having to read the tests
for the function, relying on the documentation being accurate, or reading
through the code of the function itself.</p>
<p><strong>In Java</strong>, we use exceptions for indicating the function is not successful.
Non-<code>Runtime</code> exceptions have to be caught and handled, which ends up with a lot
of code like this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    myFunction();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that obviously can result with a lot of run-time problems…</p>
<p><strong>In Go</strong>, a function can have multiple return values. The convention is to
return an error and the value that is wanted. Then the programmer has to check
for the error before continuing the execution. This results in code similar to
this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">value, err := myFunction()
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, it can be very easy to forget to handle the error case. The
compiler will be just fine if we forget to look at the <code>err</code> variable or if we
don’t assign it. Also this has the unfortunate side effect of spreading the
“happy path” code in many small chunks of code separated by error checks.</p>
<h2>Enter discriminated unions</h2>
<p>Although I am far from being an expert (really far), I have been toying around
with some functional languages lately. In particular, I like the simplicity of
<strong>Elm</strong> and <strong>F#</strong>, but I’m looking forward to learning more about advanced
functional programming with <strong>Haskell</strong> and/or <strong>Scala</strong> eventually.</p>
<p>Regardless, in all these languages there is the concept of a <em>discriminated
union</em>
in <strong>F#</strong> or <em>union type</em> in <strong>Elm</strong>. It allows the programmer to represent a
type that can have one or many states that can each have their own complexity.
Think about it as an “enum on steroids”! Actually <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Swift</strong> enums
are <em>union types</em>.</p>
<p>For example in <strong>F#</strong> you can create an <code>Optional</code> type like this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Optional&lt;'a&gt; =
    | Just of 'a
    | Nothing
</code></pre>
<p>That means that a value of type <code>Optional&lt;string&gt;</code> can either have the value
<code>Nothing</code> or it can be <code>Just</code> and would contain something of type <code>string</code>. This
<code>Optional</code> type is a great way of representing the potential absence of a value,
and it helps avoiding <code>null</code> pointer exceptions. Now you might say “but **
Kotlin**
already has a way to avoid null pointer exceptions built-in”, and you are right.
So let’s look at a type that is built-into <strong>F#</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Result&lt;'success, 'error&gt; =
    | Success of 'success
    | Error of 'error
</code></pre>
<p>If I write a function that returns something of
type <code>Result&lt;User, ErrorMessage&gt;</code>
then I know that I will either get a <code>Success</code> back containing a <code>User</code> or I
will get an <code>Error</code> back and it contains an <code>ErrorMessage</code>. And the <strong>F#</strong>
compiler would ask me to handle both cases.</p>
<p>This is actually very similar to a type that you will find in most functional
languages, <code>Either</code>. It
exists <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.0/scala/util/Either.html">in Scala</a>
and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/Data-Either.html">in Haskell.</a></p>
<p>And now you might say “but does Kotlin even have any way to do that at all?!”,
and you are in luck, because it does!</p>
<h2>Enter Kotlin’s sealed classes</h2>
<p>The same type that we just represented in <strong>F#</strong> can be represented as follows
in <strong>Kotlin</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">sealed class Result&lt;T, E&gt;

data class Success&lt;T, E&gt;(val value: T): Result&lt;T, E&gt;()

data class Error&lt;T, E&gt;(val value: E): Result&lt;T, E&gt;()
</code></pre>
<p>And you could use the type like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class User(val name: String)
data class ErrorMessage(val message: String)

fun myFunction(): Result&lt;User, ErrorMessage&gt; =
    Error(ErrorMessage("Oops"))

when (val result = myFunction()) {
    is Success -&gt; println("Success we got the user ${result.value.name}")
    is Error -&gt; println("Oops we got a failure ${result.value.message}")
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now this is very basic but already usable, and the compiler will require that we
do match both cases: <code>Success</code> and <code>Error</code>. It may seem a bit tedious to always
have to match on result after calling the function. After all, the extra
boilerplate is why <strong>Java</strong> developers tend to use a lot of <code>RuntimeException</code>s
instead of having to catch or re-throw them all over the place.</p>
<p>So let’s add a few functions to the <code>Result</code> class to help handle it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">sealed class Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    abstract fun &lt;NewT&gt; map(mapping: (T) -&gt; NewT): Result&lt;NewT, E&gt;
    abstract fun &lt;NewT&gt; flatMap(mapping: (T) -&gt; Result&lt;NewT, E&gt;): Result&lt;NewT, E&gt;
    abstract fun &lt;NewE&gt; mapFailure(mapping: (E) -&gt; NewE): Result&lt;T, NewE&gt;
    abstract fun &lt;NewE&gt; flatMapFailure(mapping: (E) -&gt; Result&lt;T, NewE&gt;): Result&lt;T, NewE&gt;
    abstract fun orElse(other: T): T
    abstract fun orElse(function: (E) -&gt; T): T
}
</code></pre>
<p>The full implementation can be found
<a href="https://gist.github.com/dam5s/7fad877656fa891640c115688dbe0f5a">as a Gist on my Github.</a></p>
<p>With these functions you will be able to write code that handles errors very
simply and concisely. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun fetchUsers(): Result&lt;List&lt;User&gt;, ErrorMessage&gt; =
    buildRequest("GET", "http://example.com/api/users")
        .execute()
        .flatMap { it.parseJson&lt;UserListJson&gt;() }
        .map { it.users }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, I executed an HTTP request using a function that returns a
<code>Result</code> then I parsed the response if the <code>Result</code> was a <code>Success</code>. The parsing
is also a function that returns a <code>Result</code> so I used <code>flatMap</code>. Finally I return
the list of <code>Users</code> from the parsed <code>UserListJson</code>.</p>
<p>At no point in that function did I have to handle the error branches (because my
functions are always using <code>ErrorMessage</code> for the failure case).</p>
<p>This makes for code that is <strong>a lot easier to maintain</strong>. The compiler is going
to do most of the heavy lifting for us.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/">Railway Oriented Programming</a>
(I highly recommend reading that article).</p>
<p>I would encourage you to try and use this style of programming more and more if
you have the privilege of using a language that offers this kind of feature. If
you are using any external library that throws exceptions, make sure to write
some small wrapper functions that will instead return a <code>Result</code> type.</p>
<p>Enjoy your exception free codebase!</p>

      <title>Testing Kotlin with a custom DSL for Aspen</title>
      <link>https://blog.damo.io/posts/testing-kotlin-with-a-custom-dsl-for-aspen</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.damo.io/posts/testing-kotlin-with-a-custom-dsl-for-aspen</guid>
      <pubDate>2016-07-13T00:34:56+00:00</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://blog.damo.io/posts/testing-kotlin-with-a-custom-dsl-for-aspen/aspen.svg" alt="Aspen Logo" /></p>
<h2>Where that feature came from</h2>
<p>When I started working on Aspen, I was focusing on only a few things: I want an
easy way to regroup my tests for a given function, and I want to be able to name
my tests with a simple sentence but I don’t want to have to name my tests. That
lead to version 1.0.</p>
<p>Then came Spring integration, version 1.1. Then we started talking to more
people to see what they wanted, and it became quickly obvious that a very simple
DSL was not going to be enough for some. So I started working on another DSL
that would allow nesting of the tree structure, like rSpec does. This lead to
version 1.2.</p>
<p>During the creation of that second DSL, I tried to figure out what was the right
abstraction for it. It became obvious that we are building a tree structure and
running that. So now I’m going to show you how to create your own DSL that
builds a tree structure for Aspen.</p>
<h2>Building a TestTree</h2>
<p>The goal of the DSL is to build a TestTree that can then be run by the
TestTreeRunner from Aspen. For example, with the built-in DSL, the following
code…</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyTests: Test({

    describe("foo") {
        test("a") {

        }

        test("b") {

        }
    }

    describe("bar") {
        test("c") {

        }
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>…would build the following structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.damo.io/posts/testing-kotlin-with-a-custom-dsl-for-aspen/test-tree-structure.png" alt="Test Tree Structure" /></p>
<h2>The TestTree Interface</h2>
<p>An Aspen DSL implements the TestTree Interface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">interface TestTree {
    fun readTestBody()
    fun getRoot(): TestBranch
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>readTestBody</code> function is the one that is supposed to evaluate the body of
the tests and build the tree structure, thus making the root available. It is
invoked at a particular time in the SpringTestTreeRunner for instance, the
default TestTreeRunner invokes it as soon as it needs to browse the tree.</p>
<p>The <code>getRoot</code> function is more obvious, it returns the first branch of your
Tree.</p>
<p>A <code>TestBranch</code> has <code>children</code> and optional <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> blocks. Its
children can be of type <code>TestBranch</code> or <code>TestLeaf</code>. A <code>TestLeaf</code> represents an
actual test, it has a block of code to execute and can have a focused flag.</p>
<p>All the code for the <code>TestTree</code> is in a single file:
<a href="https://github.com/dam5s/aspen/blob/master/libraries/aspen/src/main/kotlin/io/damo/aspen/TestTree.kt"><a href="https://github.com/dam5s/aspen/blob/master/libraries/aspen/src/main/kotlin/io/damo/aspen/TestTree.kt">https://github.com/dam5s/aspen/blob/master/libraries/aspen/src/main/kotlin/io/damo/aspen/TestTree.kt</a></a></p>
<h2>The Test class</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the easy part, implementing the TestTree interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@RunWith(TestTreeRunner::class)
open class Test : TestTree {
    private val root = TestBranch.createRoot()
    private val body: Test.() -&gt; Unit

    constructor(body: Test.() -&gt; Unit) {
        this.body = body
    }

    override fun getRoot() = root

    override fun readTestBody() {
        this.body.invoke(this)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an open class that is run with the <code>TestTreeRunner</code> and implements
<code>TestTree</code>. The root is created with <code>TestBranch.createRoot</code>, creating a branch
without parent, without name… The body is an extension function for the class
itself, this is the block of code that will contain your tests and build the
<code>TestTree</code> structure, it is evaluated in the <code>readTestBody</code> function.</p>
<p>Now you can start adding some functions that will help you build the tree.</p>
<p>This will allow specifying the before and after block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun before(block: () -&gt; Unit) {
    root.before = block
}

fun after(block: () -&gt; Unit) {
    root.after = block
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will add a test at the root level:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun test(name: Any = "unnamed test", block: () -&gt; Unit) {
    root.addChildLeaf(name.toString(), block)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now in order to add branches that do not allow nesting, we have to create a
function that will take an extension function for a different type. If it was
for the same type, then we would be able to call that same function over and
over.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun describe(name: Any, block: TestDescription.() -&gt; Unit) {
    val newBranch = root.addChildBranch(name.toString())
    TestDescription(newBranch).block()
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TestDescription</code> only allows adding tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class TestDescription(private val branch: TestBranch) {
    fun test(name: String = "unnamed test", block: () -&gt; Unit) {
        branch.addChildLeaf(name, block)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it! From that point you can start making your DSL even smarter.</p>
<p>For instance, I have been working on making a DSL for nicer table based tests.
You can see its
<a href="https://github.com/dam5s/aspen/blob/table-test-spike/libraries/aspen/src/main/kotlin/io/damo/aspen/Test.kt">first implementation on Github</a>.
It would allow for writing a test like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MathTest : Test({

    class MaxData(context: String, val a: Int, val b: Int, val c: Int)
        : TestData(context)

    val testData = listOf(
        MaxData("when equal", 2, 2, 2),
        MaxData("when a is greater", 3, 1, 3),
        MaxData("when b is greater", 3, 4, 4)
    )

    tableTest(testData) {
        test {
            assertThat(Math.max(a, b), equalTo(c))
        }
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>But it is still a work in progress, as I still need to figure out exactly how I
want my test to look like (that test block does not look useful for instance).</p>
<p>I hope this convinced you that it’s very simple to write your own type safe DSL
for testing with Aspen. Let me know what you think about it!</p>

      <title>Kotlin testing with Aspen and Aspen Spring</title>
      <link>https://blog.damo.io/posts/kotlin-testing-with-aspen-and-aspen-spring</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.damo.io/posts/kotlin-testing-with-aspen-and-aspen-spring</guid>
      <pubDate>2016-07-05T21:14:57+00:00</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR — Aspen 2.0 is out, check it out:
<a href="https://github.com/dam5s/aspen"><a href="https://github.com/dam5s/aspen">https://github.com/dam5s/aspen</a></a></p>
<h2>How I got into Kotlin</h2>
<p>I started looking at Kotlin around release M9, it was quite a few months before
it was released as 1.0, but it was already very usable. Kotlin promised easy
integration with your Java code, running on the Java 6 VM and a lot of features
that make the code a lot nicer to work with.</p>
<p>Having worked with Java for a couple years with some of our clients, I was
really excited to get rid of the verbosity and keep the things I like in Java: a
good build system (Gradle), easy to build modular applications, a decent type
system (that gets improved a lot by Kotlin), and a huge ecosystem with mature
libraries.</p>
<p>Our first production project for a client was using Kotlin M12 for an Android
application. The experience was great, the client developers were former C#
developers. They loved the language, and despite a few quirks here and there, we
shipped it by the time Kotlin M13 was released. A few weeks later, Kotlin 1.0
was released.</p>
<p>Now I have been through a couple more projects with Kotlin and I would advise
any Java developer out there to look into it. It’s easy to get started with, and
you can introduce it in your existing projects without pain.</p>
<h2>Why I decided to create Aspen</h2>
<p>I have been really enjoying the simplicity of Java unit tests using JUnit. Its
simplicity encourages you to write simple tests that are easy to read. Using
only one “@Before” annotated function encourages you to make each test readable
from top to bottom without having to jump around.</p>
<p>The only thing I really miss from my Ruby days was being able to write a short
sentence to describe my test. With JUnit, I would name tests following this
pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public void testMyFunction              // testing the happy path
public void testMyFunction_WhenInput... // testing another context
</code></pre>
<p>Some developers would also describe the expected outcome in the function name. I
do not do that because I want to encourage developers in my team to name
variables and write assertions that talk for themselves. Also I do not want to
have yet another comment that can get out of sync easily.</p>
<p>Kotlin allowing to create type safe DSLs, I decided to write a DSL for testing.
It is inspired by RSpec and Spek, but it is a lot simplified and easy to extend
with your own DSL if you would like.</p>
<h2>Here comes Aspen</h2>
<p>An Aspen test looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class PersonTestExample : Test({
    describe("#fullName") {
        test {
            val person = buildPerson(
                firstName = "Jane",
                lastName = "Doe"
            )
            assertThat(person.fullName(), equalTo("Jane Doe"))
        }

        test("with a middle name") {
            val person = buildPerson(
                firstName = "John",
                middleName = "William",
                lastName = "Doe"
            )
            assertThat(person.fullName(), equalTo("John W. Doe"))
        }
    }

    describe("#greeting") {
        test {
            val person = buildPerson(
                firstName = "Jane",
                lastName = "Doe"
            )
            assertThat(person.greeting(), equalTo("Greetings Jane!"))
        }
    }

<p>With the help of a few colleagues (Joe, Jack, Mike G, Travis, Nathan, Alex…
thanks guys!), we wrote Aspen. It’s a really simple DSL that makes unit tests
easier to organize, and it’s built on top of JUnit.</p>
<h2>Spring Integration</h2>
<p>A big requirement for us to use a testing framework: it has to work with Spring.
Most of the tests we write with Spring are pure unit tests, so that already just
works. But we also have a few tests that require us to use the Spring test
runner in order to spin up the server and run some higher level tests.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Spring team has done a great job at abstracting the way the
Spring runner work. It’s been very easy to write our own runner for Spring that
reuses the code by the Spring team.</p>
<p>A test with Aspen Spring can look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@RunWith(SpringTestTreeRunner::class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(ExampleApplication::class)
@WebIntegrationTest("server.port:0")
class SpringApplicationTestExample : Test({

  val message: String = inject("myMessage")
  val port = injectValue("local.server.port", Int::class)
  val client = OkHttpClient()

  test("GET /hello") {
    val request = Request.Builder()
      .url("http://localhost:$port/hello")
      .build()
    val response = client.newCall(request).execute()

    val body = response.body().string()

    assertThat(body, equalTo("""{"hello":"world"}"""))
    assertThat(body, equalTo("""{"hello":"$message"}"""))
  }

  test("GET /world") {
    //...
  }
})
</code></pre>
